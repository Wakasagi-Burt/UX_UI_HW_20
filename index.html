          Chat Box was an app my team and I designed with the vision of helping
          those who needed a little more structure in their lives. We felt that
          with so many platforms to message on it can be a bit overwhelming.
          Chat Box can help centralize and prioritize any and all of your
          messages from different platforms from your phone, or desktop
          computer.

          My role in this project was to help interview possible users and
          create our teams proto-persona. From there I our team wireframed our
          low fidelity interface. I created our first iteration of our mid
          fidelity prototype. The whole team colalborrated thereafter to create
          our final design.
